# reactWithFlux

To build this sample code I gone through “Pluralsight” video of react and flux.

To run this project you need to have Node installed on your machine. If it is not installed then please go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow steps.

Once you have node installed go to command prompt and run command "node –v" to verify node is installed properly.

Once you are done with node verification. From command prompt go to the folder where this code resides then run below commands

1. npm install
2. gulp

Once above commands run successfully you will have a running web app with react and flux.
